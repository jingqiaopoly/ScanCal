# User Manual of ScanCal Software

## Introduction:
This repository contains code for a planar-patch-based TLS self-calibration algorithm. The software takes in raw point cloud from a TLS, extracts and weights high-quality planar patches (PPs), uses the PPs for scanner calibration model and pose parameter estimation. The output of the software are the estimated parameters, their precision, etc. 

The PDF document can be found in [docs](docs/PP%20codes%20document.pdf).

This package has been tested under:

- **MATLAB 2022a** and **MacOS 12.6 M1 Pro**
- **MATLAB 2019a** and **Windows 10**


An overview of the PP-based calibration algorithm is shown in figure 1 below.

## Usage
### 1.	Project Settings and Data Preparation
The related paths and parameter settings are defined in the script ProjectSettings:
1)	**Paths**: define the base path and result path 
2)	**selfCal**: 
Scanner calibration model related settings, e.g.,

    - 'model' define the to be used scanner calibration model, such as NIST10, NIST8…
    - 'isEvalNISTn' define the index of estimated NIST parameters 
    - 'kap_ref_NISTn' reference values of the parameters
    - 'initNISTn' initial values of the parameters
    - 'sigmaNISTn' a priori variance of the parameters
    
    It should be noted that NIST10 can only be used when scans are from 2 or more stations.
3)	**normDis**: normal distance related settings

The input of the main program scanCalPlane are the raw scan dataset (.mat file for each station containing scanData and metaData). Please refer to the script scanData.m and metaData.m for the definition of scanData and metaData. You may generate such raw dataset yourself according to the definition of scanData and metadata, or use the script loadPtx to transfer a .ptx scan file to the required .mat file.



### 2.	scanCalPlane
scanCalPlane is the main program implementing the PP-based scanner calibration algorithm.  With the program base path (base), result path (result_folder), and other related information (selfCal, normDis) defined in ProjectSettings, we can conduct scanner calibration as follows: 
-	Open the program in its base path, e.g., F:\Codes\ScanCal\' (startup.m runs automatically if matlab is started at the program base path, otherwise, run startup.m manually) 
- 	In command window: 
    -	obj=selfCal();
    -	obj.scanCalPlane();
    -	Choose the data folder in the first pop-up window, e.g., exampleDataset
    -	Choose the datasets to be processed in the second pop-up window, e.g., setup1_24mm_Scan.mat, setup2_24mm_Scan.mat, setup5_24mm_Scan.mat, setup6_24mm_Scan.mat. 
    
        For this exemplary dataset, setup1 & 2 are two face scans from the same station, setup5&6 are two face scans from another station.

Then, the program will run automatically to do scanner calibration. The users are referred to Fig 1 and comments within the codes for the processing details. The estimated parameters and their accuracy will be output in the command window, files, and plots. The figures below show the plots generated by the program using the exemplary dataset.
